# Product Brief: Course-Content-to-Study-Guide Generator

## Purpose and Value Proposition

The Course-Content-to-Study-Guide Generator transforms passive educational content into active learning materials. It converts lecture slides, PDFs, and readings into structured study guides complete with practice questions, concept maps, and knowledge assessments—reducing preparation time from hours to minutes while improving learning outcomes.

## Core Problem

Students and educators face three critical challenges:

1. **Time Scarcity**: Creating comprehensive study materials from lectures requires 3-5 hours per topic
2. **Cognitive Load**: Extracting key concepts and relationships from dense academic content is mentally taxing
3. **Assessment Gap**: Students lack immediate feedback mechanisms to validate understanding before exams

Traditional note-taking tools offer organization but not transformation. This product bridges the gap between content consumption and active learning.

## Target Users and Use Cases

### Primary Users
- **University Students** (18-25): Converting lecture materials into exam preparation guides
- **Graduate Students**: Synthesizing research papers and thesis materials into reviewable formats
- **Educators**: Generating supplementary materials and formative assessments for courses

### Secondary Users
- **Professional Learners**: Creating study materials for certification exams (CPA, PMP, AWS)
- **Corporate Training**: Converting compliance and onboarding materials into interactive guides

### Key Use Cases
- Pre-exam study guide generation from semester materials
- Weekly review materials from lecture recordings and slides
- Literature review synthesis for research projects
- Spaced repetition card generation for long-term retention

## Core Features and Differentiators

### MVP Features
1. **Multi-Format Ingestion**: PDF slides, DOCX documents, image-based content (OCR)
2. **Intelligent Summarization**: Hierarchical concept extraction with context preservation
3. **Practice Question Generation**: Multiple formats (MCQ, short answer, case studies)
4. **Visual Concept Mapping**: Automatic relationship mapping between topics
5. **Customizable Output**: Adjust detail level, question difficulty, and format

### Differentiators
- **Context-Aware Processing**: Maintains academic rigor and subject-specific terminology
- **Multi-Modal Understanding**: Processes text, diagrams, tables, and equations
- **Learning Science Integration**: Incorporates Bloom's Taxonomy and spacing algorithms
- **Export Flexibility**: PDF, Markdown, Anki flashcards, or interactive web format

### Competitive Advantages
Unlike generic summarization tools (Quizlet, Notion AI), this system:
- Preserves academic context and citation chains
- Generates higher-order thinking questions (analysis, synthesis, evaluation)
- Creates interconnected knowledge structures rather than isolated facts
- Supports technical content (code, formulas, diagrams) with specialized parsing

## Vision for Scalability and Monetization

### Phase 1: Individual Product (Current)
- Freemium model: 5 study guides/month free, $12/month unlimited
- Target: 10,000 active users in Year 1
- Distribution: University partnerships, student communities, Reddit/Discord

### Phase 2: Institutional Licensing (6-12 months)
- University-wide licenses ($5,000-$15,000/year per institution)
- LMS integration (Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle)
- Analytics dashboard for instructors tracking student engagement
- White-label options for corporate training departments

### Phase 3: Platform Ecosystem (12-18 months)
- Marketplace for instructor-created templates and question banks
- API access for EdTech integrations ($0.05/document processed)
- AI tutor mode: Conversational Q&A based on generated study guides
- Collaborative study rooms with shared materials

### Revenue Projections
- **Year 1**: $150K (individual subscriptions + 5 pilot institutions)
- **Year 2**: $800K (50 institutions + 25K individual users + API revenue)
- **Year 3**: $2.5M (200 institutions + marketplace revenue share)

### Strategic Positioning
This product sits at the intersection of EdTech, AI productivity, and learning science—a rapidly expanding market projected to reach $404B by 2025. By focusing on transformation rather than transcription, we address a fundamental need in education: helping learners actively construct knowledge rather than passively consume content.
